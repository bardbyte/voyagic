# Voyagic

**Your AI Research Companion — Discover, Decode, and Design Tomorrow's Breakthroughs Today**

---

## 🧠 Overview

Voyagic is an AI-powered research synthesis engine designed for those who want to stay ahead in the world of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, and Physics. As new papers are published on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), Voyagic continuously scans, classifies, and summarizes them into digestible insights — transforming raw research into actionable understanding.

But we go one step further.

Voyagic also **maps interconnections** between ideas across papers, offering **intelligent suggestions** for cross-disciplinary research directions. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or visionary thinker, Voyagic acts as your strategic co-pilot in navigating the ocean of academic literature.

### Core Components

#### 1. **Ingestion Engine**

* **Purpose**: Periodically scrapes `arXiv.org` for the latest papers in AI, Physics, and Quantum.
* **Tech**: Python + FastAPI + arXiv API (rate-limited scraping fallback)
* **Features**:

  * Deduplication
  * Metadata extraction (title, abstract, authors, categories, etc.)
  * PDF download for semantic analysis

#### 2. **Understanding Pipeline**

* **Purpose**: Converts raw PDFs into clean, structured data and summaries.
* **Tech**:

  * `pdfminer.six`, `Grobid` for extraction
  * `LangChain`, `OpenAI`/`Claude` LLMs for summarization
  * `ChromaDB` / `Pinecone` for vector storage and semantic indexing
* **Outputs**:

  * TL;DR summary
  * Core idea
  * Category tags
  * Relevance score

#### 3. **Mapping & Suggestion Engine**

* **Purpose**: Finds semantic and conceptual relationships between papers.
* **Tech**:

  * Sentence embeddings (e.g. `Instructor`, `OpenAI Ada`)
  * Graph algorithms to identify related clusters
  * GPT-generated hypothesis: "Paper A + Paper B could lead to idea X"
* **Features**:

  * Interactive research graphs
  * Cross-field idea synthesis
  * AI-suggested "project ideas"

#### 4. **User Interface**

* **Purpose**: Make complex knowledge intuitive.
* **Tech**: React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS
* **UX Highlights**:

  * Timeline of new discoveries
  * Graph view of interrelated ideas
  * Pinboard for saved summaries
  * Explore mode to generate multi-paper hypotheses

## 🔍 Example Use Case

1. **Researcher logs in**
2. Voyagic shows **today’s top 5 papers** in AI + Quantum
3. Each paper has:

   * Summary
   * Explanation
   * Key idea extracted as a "research nugget"
4. The researcher opens a graph view → sees how today’s paper relates to a breakthrough from 6 months ago
5. Voyagic generates a **cross-pollinated idea** and prompts:

   > “These two papers suggest a new approach to quantum-informed neural nets. Want to explore this further?”

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

* Multi-lingual support for international papers
* Researcher collaboration features
* GitHub-style forking of paper clusters into user research projects
* Notifications for new papers that match your "research DNA"
